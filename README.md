# Calc
Multi Function Calculator

=============================================================
Welcome to the multi function calcultator, This calculator has multiple functions and will be updated occasionally, 
Feel free to use this calculator however I'm not liabale for any F's on any tests if you use this to cheat! 
This project was made using VS Code in Python

To use, simply run the code which you should be promted to type in a symbol to choose the operation you wish to use, 
+ = addition, - = subtraction, x = multiplcation, / = division, ^ Raise to a power, pi = first 7 digits of pi, hyp = hypotenuse calculator, 
rand_int = get a random number which you choose the range and how many outcomes. 

**Do note that adding spaces or having a capital 'x' will terminate the code as it is case sensitive and won't work any other way
